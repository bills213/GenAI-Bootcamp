Alright, let's work through this together! Here's the table of vocabulary to help you translate the sentence into Tagalog. You'll need to figure out the correct particles and conjugations based on the context of the sentence.

English	Tagalog
your	iyong
friends	mga kaibigan
here	dito
did	(indicator of past tense, implied in verb conjugation)
you	ikaw
call	tawag
them	sila
Clues:

Start with the subject "Your friends" and note that it's plural.
"Are here" indicates location and state.
For "Did you call them?", you need to use a verb in the past tense. Think about how to conjugate "tawag" for "you" as the doer.
Donâ€™t forget to structure your sentences in a natural Tagalog order, which often begins with the predicate.
